# Week 1
This week I sketched out how things will be arranged on my page. I also started reading about how to use bootstrap styles and navbar. I have been struggling to understand it so far. I also collected all the data on the shelters I want to include in my map. I have been trying to get the map to work, but so far it hasn't worked. I read and collected information that will be included in my page such as why to adopt and resources for new pet owners. I also picked out the colors for my page and decided I will be adding a paw print icon to give the page a kind of continuous theme.

  # Week 2
  This week I worked on fixing my map and navbar. The navbar is functional, however it does not stay at the top while scrolling, so I need to work on that. I added all my visual content and colors. I had a little trouble figuring out the bootstrap grid for the photos at the top of the page and I may still move them around a little, but for now I am understanding the concept. The page is more interactive now and next I will be adding the text and making it preetier, as well as, making it mobile friendly.
